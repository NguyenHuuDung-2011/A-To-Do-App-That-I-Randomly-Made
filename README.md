# A-To-Do-App-That-I-Randomly-Made
This is my first project that I made for practicing. This to-do application can add new to-do, delete a to-do whenever it is done, and modify it if needed.

## Features
In this application, you can use it to replace a normal to-do list as it can:

1. Add a to-do: You can set some info like title, description, deadline.
2. Remove a to-do: If thing is done, you can click the checkbox and it will be deleted automactically.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python (specifically Django framework)

2. Run the website
